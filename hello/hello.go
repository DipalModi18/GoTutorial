// For Go, a package is just a directory
// Package called main is used to create executable binary. 
// Program execution starts in package main by calling its function which also called main.
package main

// one import declaration with three ImportSpecs. Each ImportSpec defines single package import.
import (
    "fmt"
	"GoTutorial/stringutil"  // import path is path relative packageâ€™s vendor directory or `go env GOPATH`/src
	"GoTutorial/example_package"  // Use actual path while importing and use package specified at the start of the file while using var of func
	// As used my_example.Example_sum
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(stringutil.Reverse("!oG ,olleH"))

	fmt.Println(my_example.Example_sum(2, 3))
}


// there are two types of packages. 
// An executable package and an utility package. 
// A executable package is your main application since you will be running it. 
// An utility package is not self executable, instead it enhances functionality of an executable package by providing utility functions and other important assets.
