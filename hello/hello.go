// there are two types of packages. 
// An executable package and an utility package. 
// A executable package is your main application since you will be running it. 
// An utility package is not self executable, instead it enhances functionality of an executable package by providing utility functions and other important assets.
// Package called main is used to create executable binary. 
// Program execution starts in package main by calling its function which also called main.
package main

// one import declaration with three ImportSpecs. Each ImportSpec defines single package import.
import (

// init function is called by Go when a package is initialized.
// You can have multiple init functions in a file or a package. 
// Order of the execution of init function in a file will be according to the order of their appearances.
// You can have init function anywhere in the package.
// After all init functions are executed, main function is called. =
// Hence, main job of init function is to initialize global variables that can not be initialized in global context.
